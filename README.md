# connect-four-game-front-end-project
An web page checkerboard connection game using HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript (Jquery and JavaScript play the main role in implementing all the functions), Bootstrap.



Game Rule: 
  Two players will see a 6 Ã— 7 checkerboard on the web page, then they can click on any colomn of the board in turn, but they can only dye the last grid which has not been dyed in the column they choose. If anyone has successfully connected 4 grids consecutively, he or she will win the game. (no matter it's horizontally, vertically or diagonally)




Web Page: 
  There are three sentences and the checkerboard. Once players have opened or refreshed the page, a box will pop up asking players' name. The first player will be assigned blue ('rgb(86, 151, 255)') and the second player will be assigned green ('rgb(237, 45, 73)'). Then the first player can dye the grids first and then the second player turn by turn until one player win the game. The first three lines will conbine to one line showing the winner's name. In addition, all the grids on the checkerboard will not be allowed to click and dye.
